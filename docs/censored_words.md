Starogen uses completely random gibberish to name stars, planets, etc. Since this could create words that are offensive, you can add a filter to prevent them from being generated.

NOTE: There is currently no way to change the name of previously generated things. In order for a censored words list to be useful, you will need to delete your save and restart the game.

1. Go to `<save location>/censored_words_files`
2. Add a .txt file with a name that only contains letters in the standard Roman alphabet to that folder.
3. Add each word on a new line (you must add every variation of a word you want censored since the word generator is not intelligent)
